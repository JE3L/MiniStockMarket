# MiniStockMarket

  This is basically java source code without GUI for Stock Market in which you buy or sell the share and the prize will change everyday.In this the prize of the share you have to change manually.So basically it update the value in database and for database I used file I/O in here but we can change it to real databadse.
  A customer can add or withdraw the money on his own or even customer can buy and sell any existing stock and see the current prize. Also he can see the progress of any share.
  Note that it is not log in and use application. It is just made on my own interest. It can be extended using some feature like setting upper and lower limit to sell or buy the share so that it automatically sell or buy if share cross it's uper or lower limit
  
  You can simplly download and import in eclipse and run.
